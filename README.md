# PEM-Fuel-cell-model-mini_project-
A PEM fuel cell for 10 amp load was modeled using MATLAB. The governing mathematical equations such as Nernst equation, Butler volmer equations are used for modeling the PEM fuel cell from scratch. The model provides insights into how changes in the flow rates of oxygen and hydrogen affect the cell voltage of a PEM fuel cell.
